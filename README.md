# Backend Ruby Developer Apprenticeship

There seems to be a gap in the current job market for Ruby developers in Paris: lots of startups are struggling to hire skilled ruby developers, and lots of junior developers are struggling to find jobs where they can sharpen their skills.

This program intends to bridge this gap. For six month, a junior developer (the apprentice) and an experienced developer (the mentor) will work together for a company (the hosting company). They will be on site four or five days of the week, participating in the day to day work of the company's software team. Through pair programming, code reviews, and retrospectives, the mentor will do their best to help the apprentice become a self-sufficient developer.

The end goal of the program is for the apprentice to sign a full time contract with the hosting company as a software developer.

Before starting the six month of training, the mentor can join the company one or two month early to get acquainted with the people, the software stack, and the general context of the company

As they work for the company during the program, the mentor and the apprentice will both be paid by the company. The apprentice needs a living wage (i.e. not an intership salary) to be able to focus on work and learn in proper conditions. The specifics will be defined on a per-case basis, between the apprentice, the mentor and the hosting company.

## Values

### 1 Everyone is important. Everybody matters.

This one is important enough to be repeated. We strive to be inclusive, to make software that is good for its users and its owners. We are mindful of our community, both technical and social. We are LGBT+ and allies. The point of this program is to welcome more people in the community.

### 2 We take pride in good work.

We choose to be developers, and this means we choose writing good software as our preferred way of impacting the world around us. It is a challenging task, but also a rewarding one.
Good softare is defined by an adequate tradeoff between many factors:
- how well it responds to its users' needs
- how long it takes to develop
- how hard it is to maintain

The proper tradeoff depends a lot on the context in which the software is written. Finding it and executing it correctly is a hard problem, and one we intend to tackle.

### 3 We embrace failure.

While we try our best, we are humans, and we are finite.
Just like everybody else, we will fail sometimes. And that's ok.
Each time we fail, after doing what we can to mitigate the failure, we try to understand why it happened, how we could have avoided it, and how we will be able to mitigate future failures.
We will work together, and that means sometimes we will hurt each other's feelings by mistake. We will address these issues, and try to avoid and mitigate them just like we do for technical issues.

## Audience

This is what apprentices need to know before the start of the program:
- Basic theoretical knowledge of ruby (class, methods, modules)
- Basic git usage
- How to build a basic CRUD app in Rails

This is what a company needs to host the program:
- Being willing to hire the apprentice as a full time developer if the program is a success
- Being aligned with our values
- Owning a live software product written in Ruby

## Syllabus

At the end of the program, the apprentice will be a professional backend Ruby developer. They will be able to ship features to production and maintain existing code without the help of an other developer.
They will still have room for improvement, and they will be able to keep learning upon the basics.

These are the skills they will have by the end of the program
- Using continuous integration and a staging environment for safe and confident deploys
- Understanding a bug report from a user using ELK logs, writing a test to reproduce it, and fixing it
- Building a new feature using test driven development
- Monitoring application error levels using tools such as Airbrake, Honeybadger, or Bugsnag
- Monitoring application performance with NewRelic
- Using and heavily customizing vim, zsh, and other tools for better productivity
- Managing a growing codebase through adequate architectural patterns and refactoring

The program will only cover basic front end development.

## First batch

I an currently looking for apprentices, companies and mentors to start the first batch in Paris in early 2017. Let me know if you're interested!
